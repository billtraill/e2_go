# e2_go
e2 solver in go. Done as a learning exercise to teach myself go which I enjoyed very much. It was never really a 'better' e2 solver, nothing new in the approach here.

It is designed to read puzzles in the format used here https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/eternity_two/files/Brendan/Puzzles/

It handles upto  8x8 with no problems. Above this it takes a fair bit of time to solve.

One of the  problems with this puzzle is that the more constraints you add, the slower it runs and the cost/benifit is not always clear!
